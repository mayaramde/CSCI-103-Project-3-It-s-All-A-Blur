# CSCI-103-Project-3-It-s-All-A-Blur
In this assignment you will design and implement a program to perform simple kernel based image processing filters on an image. We will be implementing three filters: 1) the Sobel operator for edge detection (using a fixed sized kernel), 2) the Gaussian blur filter for low-pass filtering, and 3) unsharp mask filter for sharpening an image (which uses the Gaussian blur filter). The kernel-based implementation you will design forms the basis for a large-class of image processing techniques, therefore through this programming assignment you will learn to implement an algorithm with wide applicability across computer science.

WHAT YOU WILL LEARN:
This assignment will expose you to simple image representation and manipulation
techniques as well as familiarize you with C/C++ operations on 2D arrays.
1. Understand multiple file compilation units and their linkage.
2. Use command line arguments to provide input to the program vs. interactive user
input
3. Understand image representation as a collection of pixels and understand the RGB
color space
4. Apply knowledge of arrays (including multi-dimensional arrays) to implement an
image-processing application
5. Create, develop, and evaluate your own processing approach to perform the
operation

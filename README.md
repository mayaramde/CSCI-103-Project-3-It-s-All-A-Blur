# CSCI-103-Project-3-It-s-All-A-Blur
In this assignment you will design and implement a program to perform simple kernel based image processing filters on an image. We will be implementing three filters: 1) the Sobel operator for edge detection (using a fixed sized kernel), 2) the Gaussian blur filter for low-pass filtering, and 3) unsharp mask filter for sharpening an image (which uses the Gaussian blur filter). The kernel-based implementation you will design forms the basis for a large-class of image processing techniques, therefore through this programming assignment you will learn to implement an algorithm with wide applicability across computer science.
